# ‚ö° ANN-Based Blackout Prevention System

This project implements an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**-based system to **predict and prevent power grid blackouts**.  
It analyzes historical electrical load, voltage, and frequency data to anticipate critical conditions and suggests corrective actions, enhancing grid reliability.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- Predicts potential **power blackouts** using ANN.
- Analyzes key electrical parameters:
  - Load, voltage, frequency, and other relevant metrics.
- Generates alerts for **critical conditions** before blackouts occur.
- **Data-driven approach** for proactive grid management.
- Visualizations of predicted vs actual system states.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras for ANN modeling (`pip install tensorflow`)
- Pandas, Numpy for data handling
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualizations

---

## How It Works
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Historical grid data is normalized and split into training/testing sets.
2. **ANN Training**:
   - The ANN model learns patterns that lead to potential blackouts.
3. **Prediction & Monitoring**:
   - Real-time or test data is fed to the model.
   - The system predicts probability of a blackout.
4. **Preventive Alerts**:
   - High-risk predictions trigger alerts for grid operators.

## üìä Benefits
- Reduces unplanned **power outages**.
- Supports **decision-making for grid stability**.
- Can be extended to **smart grid IoT systems**.
- Provides **visual insights** into system behavior and risks.
